Project Title: Simple Linear Regression Visualization

Description: This project focuses on implementing simple linear regression for predictive analysis. It involves the following steps:

Data Splitting: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

Training: The training set is used to train the linear regression model, enabling it to learn the relationship between independent and dependent variables.

Prediction: After training, the model is employed to predict outcomes based on the testing set.

Visualization: Utilizing Matplotlib, scatter plots are created to visualize the actual versus predicted values for both the training and testing sets. This visualization aids in assessing the model's accuracy and understanding its performance.

By implementing these steps, the project aims to develop a clear understanding of simple linear regression and its application in predictive analysis.
